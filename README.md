[VR developers accuse Facebook of withholding the keys to metaverse success](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/09/14/facebook-meta-virtual-reality-vr-competition/)

# Why is it interesting?
I find it interesting how Meta is starting to pivot into a whole new industry, mainly being virtual reality. From my knowledge, it is basically the dominating big tech company that truly believes that pervasing this sector will reap great rewards. Thus, I found it surprising that virtual reality devs are taking a stance *against* Meta rather than wanting to join the leading giant. But as I read more about the article, I began to understand the sentiment of these devs - that they don't want to be regulated and controlled by an "autonomous" body such as Meta, but rather have a more creative reign over their products.

I've also been aware of the trajectory Meta is going towards and it's pretty surprising like you mentioned that VR developers are against Meta rather than taking their side. I understand where they are coming from though since it wouldn't be the greatest feeling to see one of the biggest tech companies delve deep into the field you work in, possibly converting it into a monopoly in their favor.

I think its interesting that a massive company like Meta is changing course. I think that I agree with the regulation argument. Meta as an organization is probably not the best choice to regulate VR technology. I think that small developers/startups will be steamrolled by the massive VR pivot that Meta is doing which is bad for innovation in the space. I also think that Meta has alterior motives besides just making VR technology as a whole better (such as making more profit).
