# Why is it interesting?
I find it interesting how Meta is starting to pivot into a whole new industry, mainly being virtual reality. From my knowledge, it is basically the dominating big tech company that truly believes that pervasing this sector will reap great rewards. Thus, I found it surprising that virtual reality devs are taking a stance *against* Meta rather than wanting to join the leading giant. But as I read more about the article, I began to understand the sentiment of these devs - that they don't want to be regulated and controlled by an "autonomous" body such as Meta, but rather have a more creative reign over their products.
